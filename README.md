# App description

An AI learning app with two tabs
Learn
Revise

The Learn tab will be for learning any new topic I want.

### Learning tab
This tab will have a start learning button. After clicking on the start learning button, a list of different learning methods will come. I can select any learning method.

Each method will have a name and a system prompt associated with it. I will use these methods to learn various topics and figure out what works best for me.

After any of the learning methods is clicked, a chat interface will open. I will be chatting with an AI model like Gemini 2.5 Pro with a preconfigured system prompt. 

The chat will go on as defined in the system prompt. 

Once I am done learning a topic in a chat, I can mark that chat as done. I will open a new chat for any new topic that I would like to learn.

If I go back from this page, my past chats will show.
